# Login in website with xumm wallet

Thanks for visiting my cute repository. This includes both server and client which run on XRPL. The client is website developed by **React** for login with xumm mobile wallet.
The server is developed by **Express Node Framework**.

## Configure the env

First of all, you need to register on https://apps.xumm.dev/
And then create an application, and then get API key and secret and set them on .env.

## How to run

### Install packages

```
npm install
```

### Run the server

```
npm run server
```

### Run the client

```
npm run client
```

Well, you run this on local, so you need to install **cors chrome extension** for a safe test. As you know, this is for avoiding cors policy.
